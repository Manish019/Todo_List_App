🧠 Behind the Scenes (React State)
Likely State Variables Used:
jsx
Copy
Edit
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
const [todo, setTodo] = useState("");
const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
const [editIndex, setEditIndex] = useState(null);
Main Logic:
handleAdd() → adds task

handleEdit(index) → loads task to input

handleUpdate() → saves changes

handleDelete(index) → deletes task

toggleComplete() (optional) → mark as done (if line-through feature exists)
